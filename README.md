#Takeaway challenge

This is the second weekend challenge here at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/)

##The brief

Can be found [here] (https://github.com/andreamazza89/airport_challenge/blob/master/README.md).

The requirement is for a take-away system, using IRB as interface, and integrating with [Twilio's API] (https://www.twilio.com/) for text messaging. If time allows, the brief includes a bonus requirement for the interface to be solely sms-based.

##The interface
This program is intended to be run on a ruby REPL or ruby script.

##Installation
